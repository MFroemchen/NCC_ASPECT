2D ASPECT model input files for NCC study

M1 - 126 - input files for original 2D models of the NCC study with varying lithospheric thickness and lithospheric scar angle of internal friction
E1 - 16 - based on M20 - chanes in extension velocity prior and after break
I1 - no break and no crustal/lithospheric scar (AIF = 20)
I2 - no break but crustal and lithospheric scar (AIF = 0)
I3 - break but no crustal/lithospheric scar
